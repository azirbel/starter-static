# Pug-based starter kit

Good for static pages, homepages, etc.

## Setup

```
yarn
```

## Development

```
yarn dev
yarn build
yarn deploy # does the build automatically
```

Builds to a `dist` folder. If not deploying with `yarn deploy`, configure
the deployment process (e.g. netlify) to look for this folder.
